# 30 Days of AI Voice Agents Challenge by Murf AI üöÄ

This repository documents my progress in the **#30DaysofVoiceAgents** challenge by **Murf AI**.  
Each day focuses on building a fully functional AI-powered voice application, step-by-step, using **FastAPI**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **Murf API**, **AssemblyAI**, and **Google Gemini API**.

---

## üìÖ Daily Progress

### **Day 1: Project Setup**
- Initialized a **Python FastAPI** backend.
- Created a basic `index.html` and `script.js` for the frontend.
- Served the HTML page from the Python server.

**Skills Learned:**  
‚úÖ FastAPI setup  
‚úÖ Static file serving in FastAPI  

---

### **Day 2: Your First REST TTS Call**
- Created `/generate-audio` endpoint.
- Integrated **Murf REST TTS API** to convert input text to speech.
- Returned an **audio URL** in the API response.
- Secured API keys using `.env`.

**Skills Learned:**  
‚úÖ REST API integration  
‚úÖ Environment variable security  

---

### **Day 3: Playing Back TTS Audio**
- Added a **text input** and **submit button** in the frontend.
- Sent the text to `/generate-audio` endpoint.
- Played the returned audio using `<audio>` tag in HTML.

**Skills Learned:**  
‚úÖ Fetch API in JavaScript  
‚úÖ HTML audio playback  

---

### **Day 4: Echo Bot v1**
- Added **"Echo Bot"** section in UI.
- Used the **MediaRecorder API** to record audio from the microphone.
- Created **Start** and **Stop** buttons to control recording.
- Played back recorded audio in `<audio>` element.

**Skills Learned:**  
‚úÖ MediaRecorder API  
‚úÖ Handling audio blobs in JS  

---

### **Day 5: Sending Audio to the Server**
- Modified Echo Bot to **upload recorded audio** to the server after stopping recording.
- Built `/upload-audio` endpoint in FastAPI.
- Saved uploaded audio in `/uploads` folder.
- Returned **file name, content type, and size** in response.

**Skills Learned:**  
‚úÖ File uploads in FastAPI  
‚úÖ Handling `UploadFile` in Python  

---

### **Day 6: Server-Side Transcription**
- Created `/transcribe/file` endpoint.
- Integrated **AssemblyAI** to transcribe uploaded audio.
- Displayed transcription in the UI.

**Skills Learned:**  
‚úÖ AssemblyAI transcription API  
‚úÖ Working with binary audio data in Python  

---

### **Day 7: Echo Bot v2**
- Created `/tts/echo` endpoint.
- Transcribed uploaded audio using AssemblyAI.
- Sent transcription to Murf API to generate speech in a Murf voice.
- Played Murf-generated audio in the Echo Bot UI.

**Skills Learned:**  
‚úÖ Combining APIs for multi-step workflows  
‚úÖ Real-time audio transformation  

---

### **Day 8: Integrating a Large Language Model (LLM)**
- Created `/llm/query` endpoint.
- Integrated **Google Gemini API** to generate responses to user input.
- Returned LLM output as API response.

**Skills Learned:**  
‚úÖ LLM API integration  
‚úÖ Building conversational endpoints  

---

### **Day 9: The Full Non-Streaming Pipeline**
- Updated `/llm/query` endpoint.
- Accept audio as input.
- Audio is transcribed through **AssemblyAI**
- Transciption sent to **Google Gemini API**
- **Gemini API** text response is converted into Murf Voice using **Murf API**

**Skils Learned:**
‚úÖ Combining LLM API with other for multi-step workflows  
‚úÖ Real-time audio response from LLM

### **Day 10: Chat History for Conversational Bot**
- Created a POST `/agent/chat/{session_id}` endpoint.
- Used an in-memory dictionary datastore to store chat history per session_id.
- Chat history for that session_id is fetched and combined with the new message and sent to LLM
- LLM response is stored back into chat history and audio response is given to user.
-Automatically starts recording after an LLM audio response

**Skills Learned:**
‚úÖ Session-based conversation memory
‚úÖ Combining STT ‚Üí LLM ‚Üí TTS in one flow
‚úÖ Auto-triggering recording in the frontend
